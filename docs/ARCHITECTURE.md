# Architecture

comfy-draftsman is a thin MCP wiring layer (`server.py`) over tested modules.
Ground truth is always the live ComfyUI instance's `/object_info`; the server
holds one lazily created client/session per process.

## Data flow

```
UI JSON (schema 0.4/1.0)
  └─ Workflow.from_ui ──► graph model ──► edit ops / organize / validate
                                            └─ to_ui  ──► save_workflow (userdata)
                                            └─ to_api ──► POST /prompt (run_workflow)
                                                 └─ subgraph.flatten() first when
                                                    instances are present
```

- **Validation gates:** `run_workflow` and `save_workflow` refuse on
  `validate()` errors unless `allow_invalid=True`; both refresh `object_info`
  first so combo checks see the current model files. `lint()` never blocks.
- **Write-time value checks:** `edit_workflow`'s `set_widget`/`add_node` ops
  reject invalid widget values (combo membership, ranges, types) immediately
  via `validate.check_widget_value`, with closest-match suggestions; a per-op
  `"force": true` skips the check.

## Subgraphs (schema 1.0 `definitions.subgraphs`)

A subgraph instance is a node whose `type` is the definition's uuid. The
frontend expands instances client-side at queue time; the backend never sees
them, so draftsman mirrors that expansion in `graph/subgraph.py`:

- Definition `inputs`/`outputs` are boundary slots; inner links use pseudo node
  ids **-10** (input boundary) / **-20** (output boundary), with the
  boundary-side slot index pointing into those lists.
- The instance node exposes only *some* boundary inputs as sockets — match
  instance input slots to definition inputs **by name**, never by position.
- Widget promotion: `instance.properties.proxyWidgets` is a list of
  `[innerNodeId, widgetName]`; a non-empty instance `widgets_values` zips
  positionally over it and overrides the inner nodes' own values. Bundled
  templates ship it empty (inner defaults hold).
- Flattened node ids follow the frontend's `instanceId:innerId` convention in
  provenance/reporting; nesting recurses (depth-capped).
- `validate()` flattens first, so inner nodes get full checks with subgraph
  provenance on each finding. `edit_workflow` ops deliberately do **not**
  reach inside definitions — rebuild flat to modify internals.

## Gotchas (hard-won; do not relearn)

- **Dynamic nodes** (text concatenators, switches...) declare dozens of
  optional widgets in `object_info` but the frontend serializes only the ones
  in use — a widgets_values shortfall there is normal. Never pad with `None`.
- **The frontend runs `.replace()` over every string widget at queue time**, so
  a `null` widget value crashes the editor even on connected/optional slots.
- **Seed control widgets are a name heuristic:** the frontend appends a
  `control_after_generate` widget after any INT literally named `seed`/
  `noise_seed`, even when the schema has no flag (`widgets.has_control_slot`
  mirrors this).
- **Never default any path off `Path.cwd()`** — MCP hosts launch servers from
  arbitrary/system directories. Session state lives under
  `~/.comfy-draftsman` (`DRAFTSMAN_SESSION_DIR` overrides).
- **object_info is multi-megabyte** — never return it (or a full combo list, or
  a raw safetensors header) to the model. Everything recurring must be capped
  or digested; full detail belongs to explicitly-requested tools
  (inspect/export/view).
- **Token discipline:** `edit_workflow` returns a compact delta by default
  (`summary=true` opts into the full graph); summaries clip long widget
  strings; guidance sentences are stated once per result, not per item.
- **Subgraph fixtures must be realistic:** minimal hand-built defs without
  boundary links or inner `inputs` arrays behave differently from real
  exports — `tests/fixtures/subgraph_real_template.json` is the reference.
- **Subgraph edit ops** — editing subgraph definitions parses them into
  Workflow objects internally; nested definitions (depth > 1) raise
  NotImplementedError.
- **proxyWidgets** — removing an inner node may invalidate instance
  proxyWidgets overrides — a warning is returned in the op result.
- **Image-metadata metadata** — `view_output` returns a `meta` dict alongside
  images so text-only models can describe renders.

## Remaining TODOs

- **[DONE] Edit inside subgraph definitions** — flattening covers
  run/validate/export; targeted edits of definition internals are implemented
  (parsed into Workflow objects internally). Nested definitions (depth > 1)
  raise NotImplementedError.
- **[DONE] `step` constraint on INT/FLOAT widgets** — surfaced by
  `get_node_info` and enforced by validation during set_widget/add_node ops.
- **[DIAGNOSTIC ADDED] Inner nodes omitting `inputs` arrays** — lint checker
  detects missing `inputs` arrays on subgraph definition inner nodes and
  reports them as a diagnostic (with the node id and definition uuid); a
  synthetic fallback would still guess wrong, so this is surfaced rather than
  silently fixed.
