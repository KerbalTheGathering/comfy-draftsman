# comfy-draftsman

**The MCP server that drafts ComfyUI workflows a human can actually read.**

A local-first [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets coding agents (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, ...) build, repair, port, validate, and run ComfyUI workflows against **your own ComfyUI instance** — and deliver them as clean, organized, fully-labeled workflows: computed layout, colored stage groups, titled nodes, green-highlighted "knobs you may touch", and markdown guidance notes explaining which tuned settings to leave alone and why.

![A draftsman-organized workflow in the ComfyUI editor](docs/images/showcase-overview.png)

Every agent tool for ComfyUI can emit raw API-format JSON — a working but unreadable pile of unpositioned nodes. Draftsman's reason to exist is the finished drawing:

![Model-aware guidance notes and tuned settings](docs/images/showcase-closeup.png)

*The note above was generated automatically: draftsman detected the checkpoint was a DMD-distilled SDXL merge and tuned CFG to 1.0, 4 steps, lcm/sgm_uniform — then wrote down why, so the person opening the workflow doesn't "fix" it back to CFG 7.*

## What it does

- **Draft** — seed from ComfyUI's bundled templates (always current with the latest models) or build from scratch with semantic graph operations (`add_node`, `connect`, `set_widget` — validated against the live instance's schemas).
- **Organize** — the differentiator: pipeline-stage auto-layout, colored groups, human titles (`✅ Positive Prompt`, `Base Pass`), green highlights on user-editable knobs, and generated notes in two registers: *"👇 type your prompt here"* vs *"⚙️ turbo model — CFG stays at 1.0"*. Everything you'd tweak (source images, canvas size, models/LoRAs, prompts) reads left-to-right first, and preview/Show Text nodes sit right beside the node they display — no tracing wires across the canvas to figure out which sampler made which image.
- **Diagnose & modernize** — hand it an old broken workflow: it reports every incompatibility against your live instance (renamed nodes, changed widget layouts, missing model files with closest-installed suggestions) and resolves missing custom nodes to installable packs via the official Comfy Registry.
- **Port** — retarget across model families (`sdxl` → `flux`, ...): swaps loader topology (checkpoint ⇄ separate UNET/CLIP/VAE loaders) and rewires consumers, retunes CFG/steps/samplers *and* technique nodes (FaceDetailer settings are family-specific — there is no universal detailer config), swaps latent node classes, picks installed model files, and flags everything needing human judgment.
- **Validate & prove** — structural + live validation, then an actual render with an inline preview, before the workflow is ever delivered.
- **V3 dynamic combos** — modern nodes whose choices reveal conditional sub-widgets (`COMFY_DYNAMICCOMBO_V3` — e.g. `SaveImageAdvanced`'s `format`, Depth-Anything-3's `mode`/`output`) are first-class: their values are set, round-tripped, validated, and serialized to the API's dotted-key form (`output.normalization`), so a graph containing them runs end-to-end through the draftsman alone.
- **Run & watch** — run any workflow (one you just built, or one already saved in your ComfyUI) and *see* the output right in the conversation: previews come back as downscaled thumbnails to keep the chat light, with `view_output` fetching full resolution on demand. Long renders can queue in the background (`wait=False`) with live step progress via `get_run_status`. If the instance already has a long queue, draftsman says so instead of silently waiting — and can queue your test run to go *next* (`front=True`) without touching the jobs already in line. Upload source images for img2img/inpaint, and manage the queue when something needs interrupting.
- **Learn** — a two-layer knowledge system: a curated per-family floor (SD1.5/SDXL/SD3.5/FLUX/Krea-2/Chroma/Qwen-Image/Wan/LTX, variant-aware for turbo/lightning/DMD/distills) plus a **persistent learned overlay**: when the agent researches better settings for a new model, `record_learning` saves them so every future session starts smarter. A learned entry can carry its own `detect` block, so a brand-new model researched once becomes **self-detecting** next session instead of being mistaken for a lookalike family.
- **Stay current** — ground truth is your running ComfyUI (`/object_info`, live templates, live model lists), never a bundled snapshot.

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.11 with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (or pip)
- A running ComfyUI instance (default `http://127.0.0.1:8188`)

## Install

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add comfy-draftsman \
  -e COMFYUI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8188 \
  -e COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR=/path/your/agent/can/reach \
  -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/EnragedAntelope/comfy-draftsman comfy-draftsman
```

**Claude Desktop / other MCP clients** (`mcpServers` config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "comfy-draftsman": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/EnragedAntelope/comfy-draftsman", "comfy-draftsman"],
      "env": {
        "COMFYUI_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8188",
        "COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR": "/path/your/agent/can/reach"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR` is optional but recommended: it's a folder your agent (or a
sandboxed client like Claude Desktop / Cowork) can actually read, and `save_output`
/ `run_workflow` relocate finished renders there — otherwise renders stay inside
ComfyUI's `output/` tree and every save needs an explicit `dest_dir`. On Windows use
a native path, e.g. `C:\\Users\\you\\comfy-renders`. See **[Configuration](#configuration)**
for all environment variables.

Then just ask your agent things like:

> *"Build me a Krea workflow with LoRA support and a face detailer, labeled so my friend can use it."*
>
> *"Here's an old SD1.5 workflow JSON that doesn't load anymore — fix it and port it to SDXL."*
>
> *"Take this workflow I downloaded and make it neat and organized."*

### Configuration

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `COMFYUI_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8188` | The ComfyUI instance to drive |
| `DRAFTSMAN_SESSION_DIR` | `~/.comfy-draftsman/sessions` | Where in-progress workflows persist |
| `DRAFTSMAN_LEARNED_DIR` | `~/.comfy-draftsman/learned` | Persistent learned model knowledge |
| `COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR` | _(unset)_ | Folder a sandboxed client can reach; `save_output` (and `run_workflow`'s auto-relocate) copy finished renders here out of ComfyUI's `output/` tree |
| `DRAFTSMAN_TIMEOUT` | `30` | HTTP timeout (seconds) |
| `COMFY_API_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Comfy Org API key for partner/* nodes (Luma, Seedance, Kling, Runway); injected into the prompt payload's `extra_data` so headless queues authenticate |


### Using with Claude Cowork / Code

ComfyUI's save nodes only ever write inside ComfyUI's own `output/` tree, so a
finished render has to be **copied out** before a sandboxed agent can open, edit,
or show it to you. That copy lands in `COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR` — and the one rule that
makes it work is:

> **`COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR` must be a folder that *both* the draftsman server (next to
> ComfyUI) and your agent's sandbox can see** — typically your Cowork/Code
> workspace directory, or a subfolder of it.

- **Set it to an absolute path.** The server runs with its own working directory
  (MCP hosts often launch it from a system directory like `System32`), so a
  relative `dest_dir`/`save_dir` would resolve somewhere invisible — draftsman now
  **refuses** a relative path with a clear error rather than misplacing your render.
- **Same machine (typical):** point it at your project folder, e.g.
  `COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR=I:\source\repos\my-project\renders` (Windows) or
  `/home/you/project/renders`. `run_workflow` auto-relocates finished images there
  and returns their `saved_paths`; the agent opens those paths directly.
- **Check readiness first.** `get_instance_info` (call it first anyway) returns a
  `relocation` block — `{"configured": true, "writable": true, "path": ...}` when
  you're good to go, or a `hint` telling you to set `COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR` when you're
  not. The `draftsman://capabilities` resource reports the same thing. If it's
  unset, the agent can ask you to configure it **before** spending a render instead
  of after.

Without `COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR`, everything except handing you the finished file still
works — you'd just pass an explicit absolute `save_dir=` per run, or fetch previews
inline with `view_output`.

### Reducing permission prompts

Building a workflow makes many tool calls (schema lookups, validation, layout), so
your agent may ask to approve each one. Draftsman marks its read-only tools with MCP
`readOnlyHint` annotations and batches schema lookups (`get_node_info` takes a list),
but the actual prompting is your **client's** policy. To "approve once", add the
read-only tools to your client's allowlist — see **[docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md)**
for a copy-paste Claude Code `permissions.allow` block (and the tradeoffs of allowing
the mutating tools like `run_workflow` / `save_workflow`).

## Tools

**Discovery** — `get_instance_info` (version, VRAM, queue — and a `relocation` block reporting whether renders can be handed to a sandboxed client; call first), `search_nodes`, `get_node_info` (long combo lists — fonts, model files — are capped for chat-friendliness; `choices_filter='substring'` / `max_choices=N` browse the full list), `list_models` (per-folder, with `search` substring filtering; `metadata_for='file.safetensors'` returns a LoRA's embedded training metadata — base model and top trigger tags — so trigger words come from ground truth, not guesses), `list_templates`, `list_workflows` (what's already in ComfyUI's workflow browser)

**Authoring** — `create_workflow` (blank or template-seeded), `import_workflow` (paste UI/API-format JSON, **or** `name=...` to load one straight from ComfyUI's workflow browser — no pasting), `inspect_workflow` (for subgraph-packaged workflows — how newer bundled templates ship — it lists each subgraph's inner nodes and wiring), `edit_workflow` (batched ops with strict per-op schemas — a failing op stops the batch and leaves the graph unchanged; widget **values** are checked against the live schema at write time, so a made-up sampler or model filename fails immediately with closest-match suggestions instead of at run time; supports `Note`/`MarkdownNote` annotation nodes via their single `text` widget; `connect` reports when it replaces an existing link; returns a compact delta — `summary=true` for the full graph), `organize_workflow` (never overwrites human-authored node titles), `lint_workflow` (readability checks, including `no-prompt-preview`: a wildcard-generated positive prompt should pass through a Show Text node so the user sees the final text)

**Correctness** — `validate_workflow` (live checks + closest-match suggestions), `diagnose_workflow` (validation + registry resolution of missing nodes), `port_workflow` (cross-family model ports like SDXL→Flux — missing-node repair is `diagnose_workflow`/`resolve_missing_nodes`, not this)

**Execution & delivery** — `run_workflow` (validates, renders, returns an inline preview thumbnail; `wait=False` queues in the background; `allow_invalid=True` submits past the local validator when you're sure a graph is fine; `save_dir=...` — or a configured `COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR` — auto-relocates the finished renders and returns their `saved_paths`, so one call gets you a presentable file), `get_run_status` (queue position, live step progress, outputs when done), `view_output` (fetch any rendered image so the agent — and you — can *see* it; downscaled by default, `max_dim=None` for full resolution), `save_output` (copy a finished render out of ComfyUI's `output/` tree into a folder the caller can reach — needed because ComfyUI's save nodes only write inside `output/` and reject absolute paths; takes a `prompt_id` or an explicit `filename`), `upload_image` (put a source image/mask into ComfyUI's input folder for img2img / inpaint / ControlNet), `manage_queue` (status / interrupt / clear / delete / free memory), `save_workflow` (validates first — refuses to save a broken workflow unless `allow_invalid=True` — then lands in ComfyUI's workflow browser; never overwrites an existing workflow file unless `overwrite=True` — a taken name saves as `<name> (draftsman)` so your original is preserved), `export_workflow_json`

**Ecosystem & knowledge** — `resolve_missing_nodes`, `search_node_packs`, `get_model_guidance`, `record_learning`

**Prompts** — `build_workflow`, `modernize_workflow` (guided flows) · **Resources** — `draftsman://workflow-format`, `draftsman://knowledge/{family}`, `draftsman://capabilities` (relocation readiness, background runs, partner-node key)

## Run it and see the result

Whether the agent just built a workflow or imported one you already had, running it
puts the picture in the conversation. A real session looks like this:

> **You:** Run my "ZITx Zimage Turbo" workflow and show me what it makes.
>
> **Agent:** One of its model files was moved since it was saved — I've repointed
> the checkpoint loader to the installed file. Rendering now… done in 9 seconds.
> Here's the result:
>
> ![A render delivered straight into the conversation](docs/images/sample-render.jpg)
>
> The full-resolution file is `ZIT_00042_.png` in ComfyUI's output folder — want
> me to copy it somewhere, tweak the prompt, or queue a batch of variations?

The agent *sees* the same image you do, so "make it warmer and less cluttered"
works as a follow-up. Long renders queue in the background with live step
progress; inline previews are size-optimized thumbnails (the files on disk are
untouched originals), and `view_output` fetches full resolution on demand.
With `COMFYUI_MOUNT_DIR` set, finished renders are also copied to a folder your
agent can reach, so sandboxed clients can hand you the actual file.

## How it stays correct

- The graph model round-trips ComfyUI's UI workflow format (schema 0.4, including subgraph `definitions`) faithfully and serializes to API format with the fiddly bits handled: positional widget arrays (including `control_after_generate` slots — even the ones the frontend adds by *name* to legacy seed widgets with no schema flag), V3 dynamic-combo dotted keys, converted-widget connections, PrimitiveNode baking, Reroute tracing, mute/bypass semantics.
- **Headless runs match the browser.** Behaviors ComfyUI implements in frontend JS — which the raw `/prompt` API never performs — are replayed at submit time: custom pack-specific widget inputs (e.g. a LoRA autocomplete box) are serialized instead of dropped, `%date:…%` filename tokens are substituted, and seeds on `randomize`/`increment`/`decrement` re-roll per run (`run_workflow(roll_seeds=False)` to opt out). Combo-value validation blocks on missing model files and core-node enums but only warns on custom nodes that repopulate their pickers client-side, so it doesn't flood.
- **Subgraph-packaged workflows run.** Instances are flattened to API format the way the frontend does it at queue time (boundary rewiring, promoted `proxyWidgets` values, nested definitions), and `validate` checks the *inner* nodes too, with each finding tagged with its subgraph provenance.
- Everything is validated against the **live** `/object_info` — combo checks double as "is this model actually installed" checks, refreshed right before every run/save.
- The test suite includes protocol-level end-to-end tests that build, validate, organize, **render**, and save real workflows on a real ComfyUI instance — including a subgraph-packaged one.
- Module map, data flow, and design gotchas: **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Security notes

- Runs over stdio only; the server opens no listening port.
- Talks only to the ComfyUI URL you configure and (read-only) the official Comfy Registry at `api.comfy.org`.
- It never installs custom nodes. `resolve_missing_nodes` tells you *which* pack provides a missing node and how to install it yourself — custom node packs execute arbitrary code, so that decision stays with you.
