# comfy-draftsman

**The MCP server that drafts ComfyUI workflows a human can actually read.**

A local-first [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets coding agents (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, ...) build, repair, port, validate, and run ComfyUI workflows against **your own ComfyUI instance** — and deliver them as clean, organized, fully-labeled workflows: computed layout, colored stage groups, titled nodes, green-highlighted "knobs you may touch", and markdown guidance notes explaining which tuned settings to leave alone and why.

Every agent tool for ComfyUI can emit raw API-format JSON — a working but unreadable pile of unpositioned nodes. Draftsman's reason to exist is the finished drawing:

![Model-aware guidance notes and tuned settings](docs/images/showcase-closeup.png)

*The note above was generated automatically: draftsman detected the checkpoint was a DMD-distilled SDXL merge and tuned CFG to 1.0, 4 steps, lcm/sgm_uniform — then wrote down why, so the person opening the workflow doesn't "fix" it back to CFG 7.*

## What it does

- **Draft** — seed from ComfyUI's bundled templates (always current with the latest models) or build from scratch with semantic graph operations (`add_node`, `connect`, `set_widget` — validated against the live instance's schemas).
- **Organize** — the differentiator: pipeline-stage auto-layout, colored groups, human titles (`✅ Positive Prompt`, `Base Pass`), green highlights on user-editable knobs, and generated notes in two registers: *"👇 type your prompt here"* vs *"⚙️ turbo model — CFG stays at 1.0"*.
- **Diagnose & modernize** — hand it an old broken workflow: it reports every incompatibility against your live instance (renamed nodes, changed widget layouts, missing model files with closest-installed suggestions) and resolves missing custom nodes to installable packs via the official Comfy Registry.
- **Port** — retarget across model families (`sdxl` → `flux`, ...): swaps loader topology (checkpoint ⇄ separate UNET/CLIP/VAE loaders) and rewires consumers, retunes CFG/steps/samplers *and* technique nodes (FaceDetailer settings are family-specific — there is no universal detailer config), swaps latent node classes, picks installed model files, and flags everything needing human judgment.
- **Validate & prove** — structural + live validation, then an actual render with an inline preview, before the workflow is ever delivered.
- **Run & watch** — run any workflow (one you just built, or one already saved in your ComfyUI) and *see* the output right in the conversation: previews come back as downscaled thumbnails to keep the chat light, with `view_output` fetching full resolution on demand. Long renders can queue in the background (`wait=False`) with live step progress via `get_run_status`. Upload source images for img2img/inpaint, and manage the queue when something needs interrupting.
- **Learn** — a two-layer knowledge system: a curated per-family floor (SD1.5/SDXL/SD3.5/FLUX/Krea-2/Chroma/Qwen-Image/Wan/LTX, variant-aware for turbo/lightning/DMD/distills) plus a **persistent learned overlay**: when the agent researches better settings for a new model, `record_learning` saves them so every future session starts smarter. A learned entry can carry its own `detect` block, so a brand-new model researched once becomes **self-detecting** next session instead of being mistaken for a lookalike family.
- **Stay current** — ground truth is your running ComfyUI (`/object_info`, live templates, live model lists), never a bundled snapshot.

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.11 with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (or pip)
- A running ComfyUI instance (default `http://127.0.0.1:8188`)

## Install

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add comfy-draftsman -e COMFYUI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8188 -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/EnragedAntelope/comfy-draftsman comfy-draftsman
```

**Claude Desktop / other MCP clients** (`mcpServers` config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "comfy-draftsman": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/EnragedAntelope/comfy-draftsman", "comfy-draftsman"],
      "env": { "COMFYUI_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8188" }
    }
  }
}
```

Then just ask your agent things like:

> *"Build me a Krea workflow with LoRA support and a face detailer, labeled so my friend can use it."*
>
> *"Here's an old SD1.5 workflow JSON that doesn't load anymore — fix it and port it to SDXL."*
>
> *"Take this workflow I downloaded and make it neat and organized."*

### Configuration

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `COMFYUI_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8188` | The ComfyUI instance to drive |
| `DRAFTSMAN_SESSION_DIR` | `~/.comfy-draftsman/sessions` | Where in-progress workflows persist |
| `DRAFTSMAN_LEARNED_DIR` | `~/.comfy-draftsman/learned` | Persistent learned model knowledge |
| `DRAFTSMAN_TIMEOUT` | `30` | HTTP timeout (seconds) |

### Reducing permission prompts

Building a workflow makes many tool calls (schema lookups, validation, layout), so
your agent may ask to approve each one. Draftsman marks its read-only tools with MCP
`readOnlyHint` annotations and batches schema lookups (`get_node_info` takes a list),
but the actual prompting is your **client's** policy. To "approve once", add the
read-only tools to your client's allowlist — see **[docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md)**
for a copy-paste Claude Code `permissions.allow` block (and the tradeoffs of allowing
the mutating tools like `run_workflow` / `save_workflow`).

## Tools

**Discovery** — `get_instance_info`, `search_nodes`, `get_node_info`, `list_models` (per-folder, with `search` substring filtering), `list_templates`, `list_workflows` (what's already in ComfyUI's workflow browser)

**Authoring** — `create_workflow` (blank or template-seeded), `import_workflow` (paste UI/API-format JSON, **or** `name=...` to load one straight from ComfyUI's workflow browser — no pasting), `inspect_workflow`, `edit_workflow` (batched ops with strict per-op schemas — a failing op stops the batch and leaves the graph unchanged; supports `Note`/`MarkdownNote` annotation nodes via their single `text` widget; `connect` reports when it replaces an existing link), `organize_workflow` (never overwrites human-authored node titles), `lint_workflow` (readability checks, including `no-prompt-preview`: a wildcard-generated positive prompt should pass through a Show Text node so the user sees the final text)

**Correctness** — `validate_workflow` (live checks + closest-match suggestions), `diagnose_workflow` (validation + registry resolution of missing nodes), `port_workflow` (cross-family model ports like SDXL→Flux — missing-node repair is `diagnose_workflow`/`resolve_missing_nodes`, not this)

**Execution & delivery** — `run_workflow` (validates, renders, returns an inline preview thumbnail; `wait=False` queues in the background), `get_run_status` (queue position, live step progress, outputs when done), `view_output` (fetch any rendered image so the agent — and you — can *see* it; downscaled by default, `max_dim=None` for full resolution), `upload_image` (put a source image/mask into ComfyUI's input folder for img2img / inpaint / ControlNet), `manage_queue` (status / interrupt / clear / delete / free memory), `save_workflow` (validates first — refuses to save a broken workflow unless `allow_invalid=True` — then lands in ComfyUI's workflow browser; never overwrites an existing workflow file unless `overwrite=True` — a taken name saves as `<name> (draftsman)` so your original is preserved), `export_workflow_json`

**Ecosystem & knowledge** — `resolve_missing_nodes`, `search_node_packs`, `get_model_guidance`, `record_learning`

**Prompts** — `build_workflow`, `modernize_workflow` (guided flows) · **Resources** — `draftsman://workflow-format`, `draftsman://knowledge/{family}`

## Run it and see the result

Whether the agent just built a workflow or imported one you already had, running it
puts the picture in the conversation. A blocking run returns output refs plus an
inline thumbnail (real payload, abridged):

```jsonc
run_workflow(workflow_id)
// -> [{
//   "status": "success",
//   "prompt_id": "084f3e11-1563-4cc3-9abb-aa1bbf002599",
//   "outputs": [{ "filename": "demo_00001_.png", "subfolder": "", "type": "output",
//                 "node_id": "7", "kind": "images" }],
//   "preview": "inline image is a <=768px thumbnail of demo_00001_.png - view_output(filename=..., max_dim=None) for full size or other outputs"
// }, <inline image>]
```

Long render? Queue it in the background and watch live progress:

```jsonc
run_workflow(workflow_id, wait=false)
// -> { "status": "queued", "prompt_id": "18421b53-...", "hint": "poll get_run_status(prompt_id) for progress and outputs" }

get_run_status("18421b53-...")
// -> { "status": "running", "node": "5", "step": 2, "total": 6, "percent": 33.3, "ws_connected": true }
// ...and once it finishes:
// -> { "status": "success", "outputs": [{ "filename": "demo_00002_.png", ... }],
//      "hint": "view_output(filename=...) to see an image output" }
```

Then pull any output into the chat — downscaled by default, full resolution on demand:

```jsonc
view_output("demo_00002_.png")               // <=1024px, cheap to look at
view_output("demo_00002_.png", max_dim=null) // full resolution
```

Inline previews are aggressively size-optimized (thumbnail + JPEG for opaque images)
so iterating on a workflow doesn't flood the conversation; the files on disk are
untouched originals.

## How it stays correct

- The graph model round-trips ComfyUI's UI workflow format (schema 0.4) faithfully and serializes to API format with the fiddly bits handled: positional widget arrays (including `control_after_generate` slots), converted-widget connections, PrimitiveNode baking, Reroute tracing, mute/bypass semantics.
- Everything is validated against the **live** `/object_info` — combo checks double as "is this model actually installed" checks.
- The test suite includes protocol-level end-to-end tests that build, validate, organize, **render**, and save real workflows on a real ComfyUI instance.

## Security notes

- Runs over stdio only; the server opens no listening port.
- Talks only to the ComfyUI URL you configure and (read-only) the official Comfy Registry at `api.comfy.org`.
- It never installs custom nodes. `resolve_missing_nodes` tells you *which* pack provides a missing node and how to install it yourself — custom node packs execute arbitrary code, so that decision stays with you.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EnragedAntelope/comfy-draftsman
cd comfy-draftsman
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest                 # unit tests (no ComfyUI needed)
uv run pytest -m integration  # needs a live instance: COMFYUI_TEST_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8288
uv run ruff check .
```

The repo's `.comfyui-test/` convention (gitignored) holds a disposable ComfyUI clone for integration testing — see `tests/test_integration_live.py`.

## Acknowledgments

The execution-side tools — `view_output`, `upload_image`, background runs with
`get_run_status` progress, and `manage_queue` — were inspired by
[KerbalTheGathering/ComfyUI_MCP](https://github.com/KerbalTheGathering/ComfyUI_MCP),
whose author suggested merging those capabilities into draftsman. They were
re-implemented independently for this codebase; the ideas (return-refs-by-default
with a dedicated view tool, thumbnail downscaling, websocket progress tracking)
are credited to KerbalTheGathering.
